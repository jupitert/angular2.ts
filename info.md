 assets folder - contains the scss files...
 dev folder- contains all the typescript files which we usually work for construction
 node_modules- holds all the packages and dependency
 src- holds the compiled css files. we dont touch
 typings- info for typescript to identify and use certain
 
rx.js- used for observables, http for angular 2
